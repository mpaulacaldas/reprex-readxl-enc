title: "Problem with `readxl` and encoding"
output: github_document
---

The problem is this:

1. I import a file (large one, French)
1. Into my computer (Windows, French)
1. Using `readxl`
1. `==` condition doesn't work whenever I *type* the value of interest

**What is going on?** Guessing it's related to the encoding?

Here is a reprex:

```{r, child="example_reprex.md"}
```
